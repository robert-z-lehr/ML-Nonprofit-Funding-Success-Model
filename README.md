# Deep Learning Challenge - AlphabetSoup Charity

## Purpose and Goal
The purpose of this project is to create a binary classifier using machine learning and neural networks to predict the success of funding applicants for the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup. The goal is to develop a model that can effectively identify organizations with the best chance of success in their ventures when funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Summary of Steps
1. **Preprocess the Data**: Using Pandas and scikit-learn's StandardScaler(), preprocess the dataset to prepare for model training. Identify the target and feature variables, drop irrelevant columns, handle rare categorical variables, encode categorical variables, and split the data into training and testing datasets.

2. **Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model**: Design a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras. Determine the number of input features, nodes, and layers. Compile and train the model with appropriate activation functions. Evaluate the model's performance using test data to calculate loss and accuracy.

3. **Optimize the Model**: Attempt to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. Optimize the model by adjusting input data, adding/removing columns, increasing/decreasing bins, adding more neurons/layers, trying different activation functions, and changing the number of epochs.

4. **Write a Report on the Neural Network Model**: Create a detailed report on the deep learning model's performance. Include an overview of the analysis, results, data preprocessing, model compilation/training/evaluation details, and a summary. Recommend how a different model could solve the classification problem and explain the recommendation.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- TensorFlow and Keras (for neural network model)
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)
- GitHub (version control and file repository)

## Likely Outcomes
The likely outcomes of this project are:
- A trained binary classifier that can predict the success of funding applicants for Alphabet Soup with a high level of accuracy.
- A comprehensive report documenting the analysis, model performance, and recommendations for further improvements.
- A submission of the project files to the GitHub repository named "deep-learning-challenge."

The model's performance may vary depending on the complexity of the data and the effectiveness of optimization techniques applied. By optimizing the model and using various neural network configurations, we aim to achieve a predictive accuracy higher than 75%, which would indicate a successful outcome for this challenge.


Sure, let's analyze each cell of your script along with portions of the outputs where applicable:

### Cell 1:
- The first cell imports the required libraries: `pandas`, `sklearn.model_selection`, `sklearn.preprocessing`, and `tensorflow`.

### Cell 2:
- This cell reads the CSV data from the provided URL and loads it into the DataFrame `df_application`.
- `df_application.head()` is then used to display the first few rows of the DataFrame to inspect the data.

### Cell 3:
- The `EIN` and `NAME` columns are dropped from the DataFrame `df_application` as they are considered non-beneficial for modeling.
- The resulting DataFrame with dropped columns is stored in `df_application_features`.
- `df_application_features.head()` is used to display the first few rows of the DataFrame with dropped columns.

### Cell 4:
- The code calculates the number of unique values in each column of the DataFrame `df_application_features` using the `nunique()` function.
- `print(df_application_features.nunique())` outputs the number of unique values for each column.

### Cell 5:
- The code calculates and displays the value counts of each unique value in the 'APPLICATION_TYPE' column using `df_application_features['APPLICATION_TYPE'].value_counts()`.

### Cell 6:
- In this cell, the code sets `cutoff_value` to 500.
- It creates a list `application_types_to_replace`, which contains the application types occurring less than `cutoff_value` times.
- The `for` loop replaces these infrequent application types with the label 'Other' in the 'APPLICATION_TYPE' column.
- `df_application_features['APPLICATION_TYPE'].value_counts()` is used to verify that the binning was successful by displaying the value counts after the replacement.

### Cell 7:
- The code displays the value counts of each unique value in the 'APPLICATION_TYPE' column again to show the updated counts after binning.

### Cell 8:
- The code calculates and displays the value counts of each unique value in the 'CLASSIFICATION' column again using `df_application_features['CLASSIFICATION'].value_counts()`.

### Cell 9:
- The code creates a filtered Series `classification_counts_filtered`, which includes only those classifications with counts greater than 1.
- `print(classification_counts_filtered)` outputs the filtered Series.

### Cell 10:
- In this cell, the code sets `cutoff_value` to 1000.
- It creates a list `classifications_to_replace`, which contains the classifications occurring less than `cutoff_value` times.
- The `for` loop replaces these infrequent classifications with the label 'Other' in the 'CLASSIFICATION' column.
- `df_application_features['CLASSIFICATION'].value_counts()` is used to verify that the binning was successful by displaying the value counts after the replacement.

### Cell 11:
- The code uses `pd.get_dummies()` to convert categorical data in `df_application_features` to numeric using one-hot encoding.

### Cell 12:
- The code prepares the feature array `X` and target array `y` for the model by dropping the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column from the DataFrame to create the input features `X` and keeping only the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column as the target `y`.

### Cell 13:
- The code splits the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets using `train_test_split()`.

### Cell 14:
- The code creates a `StandardScaler` instance, `scaler`, and fits it to the training data.

### Cell 15:
- The code scales the training and testing data using the fitted scaler.

### Cell 16:
- The code defines the neural network model using `tf.keras.models.Sequential`.
- The model has three layers: the first hidden layer with `hidden_nodes_layer1` units and 'relu' activation, the second hidden layer with `hidden_nodes_layer2` units and 'relu' activation, and the output layer with 1 unit and 'sigmoid' activation.
- `nn.summary()` is used to display the model summary, showing the architecture of the neural network.

### Cell 17:
- The code compiles the model using the 'binary_crossentropy' loss function, 'adam' optimizer, and 'accuracy' metric.

### Cell 18:
- The code trains the model using the training data for 100 epochs.

### Cell 19:
- The code evaluates the model using the test data and displays the loss and accuracy of the model.

### Cell 20:
- The code saves the trained neural network model to an HDF5 file named "trained_charity.h5" using `nn.save()`.

That's a comprehensive analysis of each cell in your script! If you have any specific questions or need further explanations, feel free to ask.

Apologies for the confusion. The steps I provided earlier were based on the information available up to that point and did not include the specific instructions for Step 3, Step 4, and Step 5. Let me include those steps now:

### Step 3: Optimize the Model

1. Create a new Google Colab file and name it "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb."
2. Import your dependencies and read in the "charity_data.csv" to a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Preprocess the dataset as you did in Step 1. Be sure to adjust for any modifications that came out of optimizing the model.
4. Design a neural network model and be sure to adjust for modifications that will optimize the model to achieve higher than 75% accuracy.
5. Save and export your results to an HDF5 file. Name the file "AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5."

### Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model

For this part of the assignment, you'll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup. The report should contain the following:

1. **Overview of the Analysis:** Explain the purpose of this analysis.

2. **Results: Data Preprocessing**
   - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
   - What variable(s) are the features for your model?
   - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

3. **Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model**
   - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
   - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
   - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

4. **Summary**
   - Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model.
   - Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.

### Step 5: Copy Files Into Your Repository

1. Download your Colab notebooks ("AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb" and "AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb") to your computer.
2. Move them into your "Deep Learning Challenge" directory in your local repository.
3. Push the added files to GitHub.

Now, with these additional steps, you should have a comprehensive plan to optimize the model, write a report on its performance, and organize the project files in your repository. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask!
